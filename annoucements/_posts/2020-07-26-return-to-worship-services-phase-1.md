title: Return to Worship Services - Phase1
---

Dear Hardin Valley Ward Family,

We miss you all very much and are grateful that the stake has permitted us to begin returning to in-person worship services. These past few months have given us unique opportunities to increase our spiritual growth by focusing on our Savior, Jesus Christ, and finding ways to improve the Holy Spirit’s presence in our homes. We have been promised, by a living prophet and apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ, that we will overcome the current pandemic.

Consistent with this promise is the chance for us to begin again in “[meeting] together oft to partake of bread and [water] in remembrance of the Lord Jesus” (Moroni 6:6). To assemble, as a body of saints, we must do so in a manner consistent with safety guidelines prescribed by the local government and the direction from our church leaders. We will follow a phased approach as we return to in-person worship services.

***Please review the PDF file below.***  It details the guidelines and practices that we will follow for Sacrament Services in Phase 1.

We look forward to a time where we can meet again, as a ward family, free from the present constraints. We are grateful to those who join with us to make this a meaningful and safe return to meeting together. We promise you blessings in your individual and family lives as you strive to continue to focus on the Savior, follow the Plan of Redemption, and listen to the voice of a living prophet.

With Love,

The Hardin Valley Ward Bishopric
